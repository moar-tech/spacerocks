__Escape through space on stolen plasma engines while slinging photon bolts at
deadly asteroids.__ How many can you blow apart? Put on your virtual reality 
headset and pick up your hand controllers. You’ll need them if you want to 
survive.

Play [Space Rocks](https://spacerocks.moar.io "Space Rocks (WebVR)") now at

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You’ll need a position-tracking virtual reality rig with two hand controllers,
and a WebVR-capable browser. Right now in 2017 the most expensive part is the 
computer needed to run a room-scale VR rig, but take heart—by ~~2022~~ 2027 all of this
hardware will be much cheaper. And the Web will still be free. In the meantime
here’s what Space Rocks is tuned to run on:

Bring your senses of [curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity)
and [wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_(emotion)). VR is still new
and exciting — don’t become jaded. (Also, if your headset isn’t detected 
right away try reloading the page. Your pioneer spirit is appreciated!)


Run locally
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to fire this up on your own desktop machine is to start a 
simple Python server. Open up a 
[command line prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), 
navigate to wherever you’ve stored this code package, then type the 
following command depending on the version of 
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) you have
installed.  

Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`  
Python 3: `py -m http.server 8000`  

In your browser you can now navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to see 
[Space Rocks](https://spacerocks.moar.io "Space Rocks (WebVR)") running 
locally. You can shutdown the local server by returning to the command line
and hitting Control + C.


Colophon

[Space Rocks](https://spacerocks.moar.io) is a WebVR experiment created by 
[Stewart Smith](http://stewartsmith.io) and brought to you by [Moar 
Technologies Corp](https://moar.io), a consultancy for emerging technology and
strategy in Brooklyn, New York. Built with 
[VRController](https://github.com/stewdio/THREE.VRController) for

Google.

Many thanks to everyone who has helped to make WebVR possible, from the
hardware teams to the browser teams, to the framework developers, and everyone
in between. And a very special thanks to Lyle, Ed, Dominic, and whoever else
had a hand in making 
[Atari’s Asteroids (1979)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))
which was a childhood favorite of mine and an obvious influence here.
